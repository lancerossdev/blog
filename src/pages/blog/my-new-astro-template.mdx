Hey there! It’s been many weeks since my latest blog post. I’ve been busy with work and other projects. I just want to share the blog template that I created using Astro and Tailwind CSS!

## The story

So, I got bored and I decided to create a blog template using Astro and Tailwind CSS. I've been using Astro for a while now and I like it, so I decided to create this blog template so I can contribute more to Astro Community! I also used Tailwind CSS because I like it and it's easy to use.

Here is a quick preview of the template:
<BlogImage src={BasicBlog} alt="Basic Blog Preview" />

Looks simple but cool, isn't it? You can find the demo here at [basicblog.lanceross.xyz](https://basicblog.lanceross.xyz) and if you want to take a look at the GitHub repository, you can find it here on my [GitHub](https://github.com/lancerossdev/astro-basic-blog).

## What is this thing?

This is a basic blog template I created using Astro and Tailwind CSS. It’s a simple blog template that you can use to create your blog. It’s not a complex template, but it’s a good starting point for you to create your blog. It is SEO friendly, blazingly fast and it’s also responsive.

## Why did you create this template?

Well, I wanted to create a blog template because I want to contribute more to Astro and have a project to showcase on my portfolio. I wanted a blog template for anyone out there who wants to try Astro for the first time. I wanted a blog template that is simple, fast, and easy to use.

## Wow! It looks cool. How did you create this?

I started to create this template from scratch and I was planning to use it with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. I didn’t add any JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries out there because Astro does all the job for you! Feel free to add your content and customize it to your liking and I hope you enjoy using this template!

That's it for now! I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post and using my blog template! If you have any questions, feel free to ask me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lancerossdev) or [GitHub](https://github.com/lancerossdev)! I'll be happy to answer your questions!
