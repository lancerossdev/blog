      <p>I'm Lance Ross, a Frontend Web Developer from the Philippines. I enjoy building small projects using Astro and Tailwind CSS.</p><br />
      <p>I create basic webpages when I have free time after school. When not busy with doing projects and schoolworks, I really love to do exercise every night to stay fit!</p>
