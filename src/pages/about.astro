        This is the microsite version of my blog. This website is no longer maintained by the owner and has been discontinued. If you want to read my blogs, you will be redirected to my main website where I migrated my blog again. You can still access the old blogs here but they are no longer updated.

        <h1 class="mb-6 dark:text-white text-2xl md:text-3xl tracking-tight font-bold">Why need to separate it?</h1>
        <p class="dark:text-zinc-300 mb-16">
          I see some people doing microsites to seperate their blog site to their portfolio website. Doing microsites can also save time since instead of rebuilding the whole site, you just
          build a blog website. This may cost a lot since you host it as different projects but there are many static site hosting nowadays for free like <a
            href="https://vercel.com"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600 transition-colors hover:underline underline-offset-2">Vercel</a
          >.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1 class="mb-6 dark:text-white text-2xl md:text-3xl tracking-tight font-bold">Bro, just use a CMS.</h1>
        <p class="dark:text-zinc-300 mb-16">
          That's what I'm planning to do back then, but it feels complicated to setup so I just have to stick with manual editing. I use Notion to write the draft of my content and just create
          an MDX file on my posts folder, commit and push it so I can publish it.
